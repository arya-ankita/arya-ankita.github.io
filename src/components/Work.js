        <p>
          FlexM is a financial technology company offering four core products: FlexBank (a neo-banking platform), FlexPay (a digital payment solution), FlexRemit (a cloud-based remittance platform), and FlexComply (a regulatory compliance management system). At FlexM, I have contributed to FlexPay by developing and integrating e-wallet payment and money transfer functionalities, building robust APIs for seamless transaction processing. In FlexComply, I worked on the regulatory report system and periodic review features to monitor customer activity in line with compliance standards. Currently, I am working on customer KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) modules, building key components for customer onboarding and verification processes, ensuring secure and efficient financial operations. Here mostly I am working on NestJS, gRPC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microservices Architecture and other associated technologies.
